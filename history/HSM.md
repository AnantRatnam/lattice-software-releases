**Features:**

* (#2374, #2415, #2416) Replaces legacy Ethereum signing pathway with a new EVM decoder in the general signing framework.
* (#2380) Replaces legacy Ethereum ABI API with new just-in-time ABI decoder functionality, allowing the requester to include an ABI definition with the calldata in the transaction request.

* Add timeout mechanism to PIN screen, which previously blocked transition to the UI sleeping after inactivity.
* Skip wifi setup step when the Lattice system is reset and the user still has wifi configured.
* Fixes invalid callback handling which made canceling a seed restore entry more difficult than it needed to be.

## v0.10.4

*Published March 31 2021*

**Features:**

* Updates `signTransaction` request to allow for requests larger than one frame. Previous limit was 1550 bytes for data (same limit for a `personal_sign`. message). This has now been updated to 1550 bytes + 1x 1500 byte frame for a total of 3050 bytes. (#1945, #1948)
* Updates the look of the PIN screen, most notably using a larger font for the number buttons. (#1946)
* Adds BIP32 signer path to transaction request screen (#1971)

**Bug Fixes:**

* Blocks requests while ABI confirmation screen is drawn. This fixes a bug in which encrypted requests could still be made but could not be filled because the ABI confirmation screen was blocking the UI. (#1947)
* Forces SafeCard unlock before accessing a cached request when the device is unlocked. This fixes a bug that allowed the device to sign a transaction from a SafeCard without requiring the user to unlock that SafeCard first. This bug was only relevant for locked devices with cached requests. (#1949)

**Changelog:**

* #1945: Updates `signTransaction` route and all ETH transaction middleware to handle chained requests, effectively increasing the maximum transaction size by using multiple requests.
* #1948: Increases `extraData` frame size and stack size to support a significantly larger `signTransaction` payload under the new mechanism.
* #1947: Adds hook into ABI commit screen preventing inbound encrypted requests while the screen is drawn.
* #1949: Adds more context to system unlock and adds specificity over `home_ui` redirect when tearing down loading screen.
* #1946: Updates PIN screen to use larger font
* #1950: Bump to version 0.10.4
* #1955: Minor code cleanup to adjust comments and remove dead code
* #1957: Adds missing cache clearing mechanism which should have been included in #1948
* #1964: Fixes timeout mechanism when resetting router
* #1971: Prints BIP32 signer path on ETH and ETH_MSG signing request screens

## v0.10.3

*Published March 17 2021*

**Features:**

* Better detection of the SafeCard. If a SafeCard is inserted when the device boots, it is now detected. If a SafeCard is inserted in a device that is unlocked, the SafeCard now also needs to be unlocked.
* Various UI improvements such as a new cancel button added to the pairing secret screen.
* Optional BIP39 password (a.k.a. "25th word") is now allowed when a wallet is generated.
* ABI updates: ABI_V2 (released in mainnet Dec '20) now supported and tuple types (increasingly utilized by more modern smart contracts) are also now supported.
* Uniswap router V2 ABI definitions now pre-loaded.

**Bug fixes:**
* Invalid characters (non-ASCII) now represented with a single square character (🔲)). Previously these characters were either skipped or shown as screen artifacts.
* Cleanup of invalid `strncat` usage in various places.
* Fixed derivation of public keys from non-standard paths (i.e. for unknown coin types).
* Added a missing zero-initialization of buffer.

## v0.10.2

*Published Jan 20 2021*

This release contains a fix to prevent random tamper events in the field related to an overly sensitive tamper mesh. 

**Changelog:**

* #1870: Revision to tamper mesh config to prevent invalid triggering in v2 hardware revs.

## v0.10.1

*Published Jan 13 2021*

This release includes a fix relative to v0.10.0.

**Changelog:**

* #1860: Adds missing call to clear staged ABI definitions at ABI filesystem init. This functionally means that users had to approve preloaded definitions before, but no longer need to.

## v0.10.0

*Published Jan 12 2021*

This is a minor release which contains features, minor UI tweaks, and bug fixes.

**Larger Features:**

* Human readable Ethereum transactions via smart contract ABI definition loading and parsing
* Permissions v0: time and spending limits on simple ETH and BTC transfers

**Changelog:**

* #1738: Cleans up various build configs.
* #1739: Removes the staging config added previously based on our observation that it would not be useful.
* #1740: Fix associated build flags in some unit tests in light of the changes to the `DEBUG` compile flag.
* #1741: Fix typo in `CMakeLists.txt`.
* #1749: lvgl `#define` renames
* #1751: Update lvgl submodule
* #1754: System hook to subscribe to card manager events
* #1759: Reset sleep timer on card insertion/removal
* #1764: Import `cb0r` lib
* #1772: Add cbor print util
* #1781: Add bignum printing to cbor print util
* #1787: Allows for display of larger Ethereum `value` amounts -- this supports display of `value`s up to `UINT256_MAX`
* #1813: Permissions v0
* #1817: Wake device on signing request
* #1821: Compile flag for clone card feature
* #1822: Compile flag for update manager
* #1823: Language update to tamper screen
* #1824: Ethereum transaction data markdown using ABIs
* #1825: Compile flag for permissions v0
* #1827: Bug fixes and corrections to permissions
* #1828: Allow paired requesters to fetch addresses outside of the device's cache
* #1830: Fixes incorrect buffer size
* #1831: Adds additional warning text when card has one PIN attempt remaining
* #1833: Updates to submodules
* #1836: One more submodule update to add more keyboard characters to lvgl's special keyboard
* #1837: Bump version to v0.10.0 and updates several constants
* #1838: Fix test runner and add missing compile flag
* #1839: Blocks permissioned auto-signing of Ethereum transactions with non-zero data payloads
* #1842: Fix bug in `system_card_insertion_hook`
* #1843: Fix bug in permissions that was preventing permissioned requesters from making ETH_MSG requests
* #1846: Comment out erroneous screen drawing function for the time being. Will be fixed at a later time.
* #1849: Updates Ethereum ABI parser module to handle edge case
* #1850: Updates Ethereum ABI parser module once more to remove erroneous sanity check from previous commit

## v0.9.8

*Published Dec 4 2020*

* #1763: Add option to display `extraText` left-justified (defaults to the legacy center alignment) and also fixes bug in calculating the size of the pages when line breaks are introduced.
* #1770: Allows our Ethereum transaction parser to parse large `chainID` values, which were previously encoded as `uint8_t`s. Sidechains, testnets, and various other networks will use larger values for the `chainID`, which this PR enables.
* #1775: Fixes race condition in `wallet_task` that occurs during the card cloning process
* #1783: Fixes a nasty bug where the device times out and blanks the screen while the user is writing down their seed phrase. We should have had a block on that screen, which has been added in this PR.
* #1786: Adds more visual cues to the different lock screens (card vs system) to give users more clarity. We have had a few confused users who haven't been able to differentiate between the screens.
* #1795: Displays GCE SSH login credentials on the device info screen, even for production devices. Almost all of our user bugs/issues have arisen on the GCE side and not being able to debug those could lead to massive support issues. We have thus elected to display the information a user needs to SSH into the device on the device info screen. This also has the benefit of enticing developers to "hack" around with their device.
* #1796: Various language updates throughout the UI.
* #1798: Fixes bug introduced by me in #1795 🙈 
* #1799: More language updates to the UI
* #1800: Fixes an oversight from #1770. We were not skipping over the chainID in the `data` field in the transaction display screen and this PR fixes that.

## v0.9.6

*Published Sep 30 2020*

* Our first version 🎉
* Core Lattice firmware functionality
